# UMSL CMPSCI 4010 Projects
###### Instructor: [Wenjie He](https://www.umsl.edu/mathcs/about/People/Faculty/WenjieHe/index.html)

These projects were intended to test my ability in creating create simple Java web applications. Although I did more than was expected, so I researched more topics related to Java web applications. Our professor did not teach us about design patterns, so I had to learn them on my own because I felt that they were essential in building scalable, modular, and practical web applications. The overall goal of these projects was to make a web interface for math problems. The original name of the final project is [Mathbank](https://mathbank.jaredible.net), but I have changed it to focus on problems in general. The new name of the final project is [Mindbank](https://mindbank.jaredible.net).

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](https://github.com/jaredible/umsl-cmpsci-4010#user-content-deployment) for notes on how to deploy these projects on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end-to-end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
